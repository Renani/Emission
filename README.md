# About this project

This is a small project I use to test my analytics in React and D3JS. Most noteworthy is the Pareto Diagram created. The data used here is entirely fictional and random. 
My conclusion was that I need to learn more about both of these framework and best practices, but it is relatively easy to come to a result. 

See Emission.pdf 

BUG: only works in firefox (ordering of bars in the Pareto diagram is different in chrome)
